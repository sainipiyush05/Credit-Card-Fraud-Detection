# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions is crucial for financial institutions to prevent losses and maintain customer trust. This project employs machine learning techniques to identify and classify fraudulent activities within credit card transactions.

📌 **Why Credit Card Fraud Detection?**
- 🛡️ Protects customers from unauthorized transactions
- 💳 Maintains the integrity of financial systems
- 📉 Reduces financial losses for banks and merchants
- 🔍 Enhances the accuracy of fraud detection systems

## ⚙️ How It Works  

📌 **Step 1: Data Collection**  
- The dataset `creditcard1.csv` contains credit card transactions, including features like transaction time, amount, and anonymized variables resulting from a PCA transformation.  

📌 **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**  
- Handles missing values and scales features to ensure effective model performance.  

📌 **Step 3: Model Training**  
- Applies machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.  

📌 **Step 4: Evaluation**  
- Assesses model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  

📌 **Step 5: Visualization**  
- Provides visualizations to understand data distributions and model performance.
