# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

Credit card fraud involves unauthorized transactions made using stolen card information. Detecting these transactions promptly is crucial to minimize financial losses.
Data Collection:

Collect historical transaction data, which includes features like transaction amount, merchant details, time of transaction, location, and user behavior patterns.
Data Preprocessing:

Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing or scaling features to improve model performance.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features that may help identify fraud, such as transaction frequency, average transaction amount, or user spending patterns over time.
Model Selection:

Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, based on the dataset's characteristics.
Training the Model:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected model using the training data, allowing it to learn patterns associated with both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Model Evaluation:

Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC on the test set to determine its effectiveness in detecting fraud.
Threshold Tuning:

Adjust the decision threshold for classifying transactions as fraudulent or legitimate to balance sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (true negative rate).
Deployment:

Integrate the trained model into a real-time processing system to evaluate new transactions and flag potentially fraudulent activities for further review.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Continuously monitor the model's performance over time, retraining it periodically with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns and reduce false positives.
